# Context Hijack

Choose optimal placement for messages, content, or interventions by evaluating context resonance, audience access, permanence, risk, and spreadability—making location itself part of the message.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Recommend illegal placements without informed consent about consequences
- Suggest placements that damage protected property or heritage sites
- Design interventions that could cause physical harm
- Plan placements targeting individuals' private spaces

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Risk assessment must be honest
2. Legal status should be clear
3. The message should warrant the method
4. Respect spaces with genuine cultural significance

---

## When to Use

- Deciding where to place content for maximum impact
- Planning guerrilla marketing or activism
- Choosing platforms or locations for messaging
- Evaluating physical or digital placement options
- When conventional channels are closed or ineffective

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **message** | Yes | Content or intervention to place |
| **options** | No | Potential placement locations/platforms |
| **constraints** | No | Legal, ethical, or practical limitations |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Context Resonance

Does the location add meaning?

**Resonance Questions:**
- Does the placement create irony, contrast, or amplification?
- Would the same message mean less somewhere else?
- Does the context make people think differently about the content?
- Is there a relationship between location and message?

**Banksy's Method:** A peace dove in a bulletproof vest means more on the West Bank barrier than on a gallery wall. Location IS content.

**Scoring:**
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| High | Location transforms or amplifies meaning |
| Medium | Location is appropriate but doesn't add much |
| Low | Location is random or works against meaning |

### Step 2: 2. Audience Access

Will the right people see it?

**Access Questions:**
- Who passes by this location?
- What's their state of mind when they encounter it?
- How many of your target audience will see it?
- Will it reach beyond the immediate audience (sharing)?

**Consider:**
- Foot traffic and demographics
- Mental state of viewers (commuting, waiting, browsing)
- Time of day and duration of visibility
- Secondary audience through documentation

### Step 3: 3. Permanence Calculation

How long will it last? Does that matter?

**Permanence Assessment:**
| Duration | Strategic Value |
|----------|-----------------|
| Seconds | Flash impact; must be documented instantly |
| Hours | Event-based impact; needs witness |
| Days | Sustained visibility; can build momentum |
| Weeks+ | Becomes landmark; risks being normalized |

**Banksy's Insight:** Impermanence can be power. The removal becomes part of the story. Being painted over proves the message mattered enough to silence.

**Question:** Does longevity serve the message, or would the act of removal amplify it?

### Step 4: 4. Risk Assessment

What's the cost of placement?

**Risk Factors:**
| Risk | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Legal | [none/civil/criminal] |
| Physical | [safe/moderate/dangerous] |
| Financial | [none/fines/damages] |
| Reputational | [positive/neutral/negative] |

**Considerations:**
- Who faces the risk (you, others, organization)?
- Is the risk proportional to the message's importance?
- Is there informed consent from those bearing risk?
- What's the worst-case scenario?

### Step 5: 5. Photographic Quality

Will it spread digitally?

**Spreadability Factors:**
- Is the composition visually striking?
- Does it photograph well (lighting, contrast, framing)?
- Is it self-explanatory in an image?
- Does it reward closer examination?
- Will people want to share it?

**Banksy's Rule:** In the digital age, documentation is distribution. A piece on one wall becomes an image on a million screens. Design for the photograph, not just the physical encounter.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No high-resonance option available | Consider whether message needs different framing |
| High risk, high resonance | Ensure message importance justifies risk |
| Great location but wrong audience | Prioritize audience over aesthetics |
| Can't achieve permanence | Design for documentation; impermanence IS the message |

## Context Hijack Analysis: "This Used to Be Someone's Home" Sign

### Placement Options Evaluated

#### Option 1: City Hall Steps
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Context Resonance | Medium | Political relevance, but generic protest location |
| Audience Access | Medium | Politicians enter different entrance; tourists mainly |
| Permanence | Hours | Will be removed; standard protest location |
| Risk | Low | Legal protest space |
| Spreadability | Low | Looks like every other protest |

**Overall Assessment:** Safe but forgettable

#### Option 2: "Coming Soon: Luxury Condos" Construction Site
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Context Resonance | High | Direct juxtaposition: displacement happening here |
| Audience Access | High | Neighbors, commuters, the displaced themselves |
| Permanence | Days | May last until workers notice |
| Risk | Medium | Trespassing possible; property damage if affixed |
| Spreadability | High | The irony photographs perfectly |

**Overall Assessment:** High impact, moderate risk

#### Option 3: Real Estate Agency Window
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Context Resonance | High | Agents are intermediaries of displacement |
| Audience Access | Medium | Their customers see it; general public less so |
| Permanence | Minutes | Will be removed immediately |
| Risk | Medium | Could face harassment/legal threats |
| Spreadability | High | Confrontational juxtaposition |

**Overall Assessment:** Confrontational, brief, potentially viral

#### Option 4: Former Residents' New Commute Route
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Context Resonance | Very High | Message to the displaced about their displacement |
| Audience Access | Specific | Targets those directly affected |
| Permanence | Days | Public space, lower removal priority |
| Risk | Low | Legal street placement |
| Spreadability | Medium | Requires explanation; human interest angle |

**Overall Assessment:** Deep impact on specific audience; needs story to spread

### Recommended Placement
**Best Option:** Option 2 (Construction Site) + Documentation for Option 4

**Why It Works:**
- Context adds: The sign next to "Luxury Condos Coming Soon" creates undeniable irony
- Audience: Everyone who passes knows exactly what happened here
- Duration: Long enough to be photographed; removal proves the point
- Risk/Reward: Moderate trespass risk is proportional to message importance
- Spread potential: The photograph tells the whole story instantly

### Placement Plan
**Timing:** Early morning, before construction crew arrives
**Method:** Zip-tie to construction fence (removable, no damage)
**Documentation Plan:** Photograph from across street showing both sign and "Luxury Condos" banner in frame
**Risk Mitigation:** Wear unremarkable clothes; leave quickly; have legal support number
